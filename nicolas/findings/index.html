			<h3>User Interviews</h3>

			<p>Of the four user research parts, user interviews were one of the most important because they gave me insight into the type of people that would be visiting my site, and what kinds of things they might be looking for. I started each interview by asking the interviewees about their current occupation, as well as their goals and challenges. The meat of the interviews consisted of questions surrounding a scenario in which they are in a position to hire a candidate, and what they would expect from visiting a candidate&rsquo;s portfolio site.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>As part of my competitor analysis, I visited the personal portfolio sites of individuals in my field. I follow many people on Twitter across a range of ages that share at least one aspect of my career focus, so all of the sites I analyzed stemmed from this group of individuals. These analyses were especially helpful in identifying which aspects of each site I wanted to incorporate into my own, as well as those I thought I could improve upon. These served as a blueprint of sorts that I could refer back to when sketching out the initial idea for my site.</p>

			<h3>Feature-Value Matrix</h3>

			</figure>
			<p>The feature-value matrix was used to rank each feature I planned on including in my site by its value. The value of a feature was calculated by determining its user value, business value, and development effort&mdash;the sum of which produced a fairly objective number by which these features could be ranked against each other. The placement of these features in the ranking helped me choose which ones should be implemented first.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>This part of my research was a natural extension of my feature-value matrix. It was particularly helpful because the visual placement of the prospective features for my site on the graph were essential to my understanding of how they stacked up against each other in terms of priority.</p>

			<h3>User Stories</h3>

			</figure>
			<p>The user stories helped me generate concrete, testable examples of use cases of tasks my target audience might be trying to accomplish. While this was not very valuable as the first part of the user testing phase, it was practical primarily for checking whether the site I had built met the needs of my users at the very end of my user research and testing.</p>

			<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>

			</figure>
			<p>The cognitive walkthroughs were hands down the most insightful part of the user testing phase. Sitting next to my users as they used my site to see just how they interact with it proved immensely useful, even when they were not verbal about their actions. The simple act of their scrolling through or pausing while viewing a particular section of the page helped me identify the pain points users commonly encountered while trying to get something done. One of the main challenges in conducting them, however, was getting people to agree to take part in the walkthrough in person.</p>

			<p>I set up and conducted a total of 5 task-based online tests: three were simple click tests, and two were short question tests. The subject of these tests were founded on the pain points I recognized when conducting the cognitive walkthroughs, in order to see whether the difficulties the users encountered were one-offs or more widespread issues. These tests, however, were not as useful as I had hoped&mdash;perhaps because not enough people took the tests in order for me to draw more accurate conclusions from the results.</p>

		<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
		<article>
			<p>One of the main things I took away from the cognitive walkthroughs is that it was difficult for some users to easily parse the body of text in the Home section for my contact, r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and social media links. While I initially believed that including these links towards the top of the page would make it easier for users to access them quickly, it turned out that most users were expecting these things to be located in some kind of bar or footer at the bottom of the page, and this led to their difficulty in finding them.</p>
			<p>Another issue that was brought up was that it was not particularly easy to determine whether my primary area of expertise is in web development or iOS development. Many users were quick to point out that I had showcased more websites than apps, therefore I must prefer web development, however, I actually have more experience developing iOS apps&mdash;having written nearly <mark>100,000</mark> lines of code in <span class="skill">Objective-C</span>, plus close to <mark>40,000</mark> lines of code in <span class="skill">Swift</span>, but only a <em>combined</em> <mark>40,000</mark> lines of code in <span class="skill">HTML</span>, <span class="skill">CSS</span>, <span class="skill">PHP</span>, and <span class="skill">JavaScript</span>. A separate piece of feedback I received from one of my users during testing, as well as from another user in my initial research interview, was that there could be more of a focus on data and project details. I feel this point is in the same vein as the one I just described, so I will regard them as one.</p>
			<p>One last minor issue that surfaced was that, aside from the images and centered lists of items, the page appeared too plain and the text all looked the same, making it hard to get highlights into the content. I also found this to be the case&mdash;<em>to some extent.</em></p>

		<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
		<article>
			<p>In order to solve the issue regarding the hard-to-find contact and social media links, I created three separate task-based online tests: two click tests to see if people could locate both my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and my email address, and one question test about the discoverability and expectations of my contact and social media links. Since the online tests were inconclusive <em>(largely because the response rate was too low)</em>, I designed and implemented four different solutions to the problem, and gathered feedback from a couple of users in person. This method of testing proved to be more useful, and I ended up adding a footer bar with icons linked to my email, r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and social media accounts that sticks to the bottom of the browser window and follows the user as they scroll through the page.</p>
			<p>To address the issue concerning the lack of highlights within the content of my page, I promoted the phrases directly preceding any images or list of items in my About section from the paragraph tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to the bolded level 4 header tag <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>. This helps give a little more context to the images that were already found to stand out in the About section</p>
			<p>The last issues were in connection with the difficulty of determining my primary area of expertise, and the apparent lack of raw data or project details. Due to lack of time, I was unable to incorporate a solution to this problem, but have already determined a couple solutions worth exploring. First, I plan on including the number of lines of code I have written in each of the programming languages I listed, and am considering adding a bar chart that visually demonstrates these numbers. Next, I would like to produce a few case studies about the projects I learned from the most, and link to those from a new section on my homepage. Including case studies for my projects was already identified in my feature-value matrix, but I had determined that it would be one of the most time-consuming features to implement effectively, so it was left out of both iterations of this project, in the interest of time.</p>
			<p>Other smaller changes and fixes were made to the site since the midterm due date on November 13, which are listed and can be seen in more detail in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nicolasgomollon/gomollon.me/commits/master">commits to the GitHub repository for this website</a>.</p>
